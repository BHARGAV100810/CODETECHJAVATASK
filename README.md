Simple Calculator Documentation
1. Introduction
The Simple Calculator program is a Java application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It provides users with a straightforward interface to input two numbers and choose an operation to apply to them.

2. Features
The calculator offers the following features:

Addition: Add two numbers together.
Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
Division: Divide one number by another.
3. Usage
3.1 Launching the Program
To start the calculator, execute the program in a Java environment.

3.2 Selecting an Operation
Upon launching the program, the user is prompted to select an operation by entering a corresponding number. The available options are:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
3.3 Entering Numbers
After selecting an operation, the user is prompted to input two numbers. These numbers can be integers or decimals.

3.4 Viewing the Result
Once the numbers are entered, the program calculates the result based on the selected operation and displays it to the user.

4. Error Handling
4.1 Division by Zero
The program checks for division by zero. If the user attempts to divide by zero, an error message is displayed, and the program terminates gracefully.

4.2 Invalid Inputs
Invalid inputs, such as non-numeric characters or incorrect operation selections, prompt the user to enter valid input. The program provides appropriate error messages and guidance.

5. Example
Suppose the user wants to perform an addition operation:

The user launches the program.
Selects addition by entering '1'.
Inputs the first number, for example, '5'.
Inputs the second number, for example, '3'.
The program calculates the result and displays '8'.
6. Dependencies
The Simple Calculator program relies on the Java standard library for basic input/output operations and arithmetic calculations. It does not require any external dependencies.

7. Limitations
7.1 Basic Arithmetic Operations
The calculator supports only basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It does not handle more advanced mathematical functions.

7.2 Numeric Input Only
The program accepts numeric inputs only. Non-numeric characters are treated as invalid input.

7.3 No Memory Functionality
The calculator does not have memory functionality to store previous results for subsequent calculations.

7.4 Limited Precision
Due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic, the program may exhibit slight inaccuracies in calculations involving decimal numbers.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Simple Calculator program, including its features, usage instructions, error handling, example, dependencies, and limitations.
